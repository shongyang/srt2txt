[Music] yes i was told to refer to this sanitation list let me know if i missed anything else michelle mrca president dr dr jennifer mrc advisor dr street gary chua mrca immediate vice president honorary presidents of mrca dr albert chem dr k sim kings after 3 years singapore disney 2 president advisor dr lubin mrca cu get together organizing care person mrcax schools councils youth and members ladies and gentlemen a very good afternoon to all of you ladies and gentlemen it's a real pleasure and a privilege for me to stand in front of you i'm standing in front of thought leaders visionaries industry captains and leaders of your respective industries and it just gives me a very very warm heart to welcome all of you so please join me as we put our hands together to welcome all of you i was told to give a speech but i'm standing in front of you know ceos and then very very experienced people so i shall not give a speech i don't have a script for you today but what i'm going to do is to share with you very candidly and also learn from you along the way so i want to give you some perspective last year i traveled to 28 countries my fear reminded me i traveled to 28 countries ranging from southeast asia north asia europe eastern europe western europe the united states canada and all the way to the middle east and africa as well and this was an amazing experience whenever i go to different countries so when i go to indonesia the indonesian suite is indonesia you go to thailand they will tell you [Music] and if you go to hong kong malaysian and very very proud to be malaysian and then when you go to china [Music] and of course in malaysia your home country you speak differently it's just so amazing to be in malaysia where you can connect to the rest of the world with different cultures and of course when i go to korea a lot of people approach me and they say i think i've seen you on some k-pop channel i'm just a simple malaysian just like all of you and very very proud to be in malaysia and you know when we go to different countries we also get to integrate and learn from the different cultures when i was in africa of you know some of the people who brought me to africa i was amazed to see that the evolution in africa was pretty amazing i saw people using cashless mobile devices to transact in the retail store when you go to china you see people doing all these things checking in through the hotels everything to online channels in germany and japan you see people using robotic arms to to do all the automation in factories and if you think about what we've done for silicon valley a lot of the ideation in silicon valley which can visit consistently is actually not done in silicon valley malaysians actually deliver a lot of these products but it's branded at silicon valley it's branded as you know the united states is branded as europe but a lot of us in malaysia have amazing talent and this is what i wanted to share with everyone today and hopefully just have a little bit of a um you know sharing session to share some things that we've actually gone through i'm not going to take too much time but what i thought is to give you a bit of a perspective 200 years ago 90 percent of the world's population worked in agriculture that's 200 years ago today about 2 percent of the world's population works in agriculture and when my staff told me today i thought i could just sit down there with all of you and just realize myself they say it cannot because you've got to stand on stage and give a speech but i've got to work very hard for them just as they were very hard for the organization but it's two percent of the world's population work in agriculture today why is that so because technology advancement has actually led to a lot of changes and today we don't need so many human resources to work in you know farms can anybody make a guess what is this auto that you see on one screen okay maybe some of you say it's a super computer it's super super computer and this supercomputer was the first machine that contributed in the landing of apollo 11 in 1969. some of us were born during that some of us were not but in this group i think maybe we have seen her enough to be able to know in 1969 you know this was a full meet-up now this super computer just to put things in the right perspective was only six megabytes improvement size that is smaller than your pokemon app that is 40 000 times smaller than your iphone your iphone has more processing power and storage compared to this super computer that helped apollo 11 in 1969 land can you imagine the advancements of technology in your computer that's in your pocket has more processing power than this super computer it can text it can do messaging and voice you can do internet processing it can be e-commerce it can do video and all of the things that you want to do and this is changing the way that we work every day the current landscape is extremely confusing people talk about social media you can see more than 243 000 photos uploaded you see 3.8 million searches on google these are just some examples you see a million swipes you see netflix eighty seven thousand two hundred and ten thousand these are of course estimates are not exact numbers but you get the point over the last 60 seconds although millions millions of reports have been generated it's not like if we go and publish your website the traffic will come naturally it's not going to be the case so this is extremely confusing and the amount of data that the world is throwing at is growing that exponentially every minute every second while we're eating when we're sleeping or we're having lunch we're having coffee data is just growing because people are searching for products online and this is something that we in malaysia have a great opportunity to understand how this grows radio took 38 years to reach 50 million users tv to 13 years internet four years ipod four years and facebook took only nine months to reach 100 million users pretty amazing but also intimidating and daunting and scary if we do not realize that and of course this room of learned people don't have this problem but we know that today we have about 7 billion in terms of the world's population we have close to 10 billion connected device which is more than the population of the entire world we by 2020 we would have exceeded 100 billion connected devices meaning to say that each of us here don't only have one connected device you have a mobile phone you have a connected tv you have a connected car perhaps it connects to this to the social media connects to internet you probably have a connected tablet as well and many more connected and your children also and this is daunting but it's what's happening so we have a very very connected world a hyper connected with tournament with 10 billion connected network and this is going to go 100 billion over the next eight years so the rate at which we're generating data is rapidly outpacing our human capacity to cope with it and we need to be able to do things much more efficiently this is as usual as we say whether in the retail space can be just normal and it might be simple because this is what we do to get from a to b we ride a bicycle this is just an analogy but if we think that's fine every day we'll write already might still nothing wrong with it what happens if we find that our competitors can actually use this to get to the same destination faster better more efficient and frankly speaking there is no reason for other people not to use this if they can go to the same destination the global landscape is disorientating there is an eruption of disruptive technologies meaning change that incumbents cannot deal with and because of the fact that there's a lot of fluidity and uncertainty businesses have to strategize today and no one can assume that traditional basis of competitive advantages will remain things are changing the only concept is change so we know about the first and second and third revolution the industrial revolution shows that first initiative is all about steam called second about mechanization and third about you know electronics and factories and of course the fourth one which is the most disruptive of them all i think we heard our energetic mrca president talk about ai talk about all the things that we're doing with all the good initiatives ir 4.0 is going to have a massive change and a massive impact in terms of how we're doing business and it doesn't just restrict one gear it disrupts all including retail so we are we're looking at how pins are changing now let's talk a little bit about 90. as we know forbidden numbers has impacted almost everyone and this is how maybe a busy street used to be in perhaps tlcc in town world and so and so forth but after 2019 things are very different pre post and after and this is not just affecting one industry as we mentioned we still have a lot of conferences with people all across the world in fact our office hours have been longer as you would imagine it's now 11 12 1 a.m 2 a.m people are not so respectful of our time anymore but we still understand that they need to function saturday sundays as well some of you might have the same problems i hope not but we have that problem that people like people are at home people are doing things remotely and this is not just in southeast asia it's europe it's in america it's everywhere and things are changing very very rapidly we work with many american brands many european members many japanese friends many korean brands many singaporeans and face masks are becoming the new normal and of course face masks are also slowly becoming the new fashion and trend temperature taken everywhere you go and our new best friend and sanitizer lots of things are changing as we speak one thing i'd like to share and put things in perspective in 1964 smp 500 companies 10 year average lifespan 33 years and that was how long this company would last before it gets acquired or whether it would disappear in 2016 this lifespan reduced to 24 years in 2027 it is only 12 years it is extremely intimidating this is from mckinsey and you will see that this information is extremely intimidating that means if companies don't evolve we are not going to be relevant so that's something so constant change is a new norm one of the things that we've seen in terms of the long-lasting profit 19 when we talk to many of our customers in and across the world that's prior less current and this and this future the new global consumer research shows that consumers are radically changing their lives in response to economy they are becoming more savvy they are still buying many consumers are facing new personal situations what that means is that maybe some of them have lost their jobs some of them are more conscious about hygiene factors some of them don't want to go up too much but they want to do the research online and consumers are shopping with greater awareness of the environment but there is a huge rise there's no denial that there's huge rise in digital commerce especially in low or new low frequency customers might need to continue prospering so you can see that the sales and and everything pre is is shaded in gray and current in light purple and of course the future so this is not going to be something that disappears that people come back to the train they are so used to working from home they are so used to dealing with things online so this is going to change very very rapidly so one of the things that we probably have to take a look at is how we disrupt and reinvent our businesses i've had the opportunity to meet up with all these guys apart from choice icon and all these guys amazing people jeff bezos jack ma kirby chen and karin always is looking of course richard branson and the way they think is crazy out there the only other guy i haven't had a chance to meet but i'll never have to see is steve jobs but the rest of the guys they're all crazy guys right and what they've done is they've disrupted different types of businesses um and just revolutionize how things really happen one thing that we should think about is that if you think of holden or gm toyota these are all good brands but when you think of tesla tesla is more valuable in all in particular how can the big health service have enough sales tesla doesn't have enough profits it's just crazy but they have actually innovated it to a state of your own right of course you don't want to take struck sometimes but the innovation stuff is there and hopefully infusion is also none of us do that how do we cope with the new world order and new economic frontier we need to think about how we deal with the world with driverless cars and maybe think about this the car of tomorrow will become of the horse will become the horse of the day let me ponder for a moment that is a wonderful moment to think about that what is the horse of today the horse of the day and the horse of yesterday the horses yesterday was a necessity the horse of today is the laundry you don't need a horse the car of today is a necessity the car tomorrow maybe you don't need a car anymore maybe there's a drivers car that takes you around you don't need to park so things are going to change very rapidly and what we think today is the norm will result in a new norm very very quickly that is what we discuss with business leaders every day they say that this is the problem i'm facing can we say what do you think is going to happen in three months time six month time three years i think it's gonna move towards this is it is it true let's think about it a bit more if you think it's going to happen in six months time then do it now because when the month number six arrives and you try to do it like what happened in kobe 19 you're right now we're going to go into a digital transformation it's a little bit too late because because it's already happened so we need to think of the next one but never too late if we are starting something early um there are a lot of disruptors netflix uber amazon airbnb we can't blame them because the market is i'm doing this does anybody know who this guy is kevin costner yeah second report right so one of the famous things that senator paul said is that people he had asked his customers what they wanted they would have told him that they needed plaster forces fortunately he didn't do faster horses and he invented the automobiles and cars and that's why we benefited from it as you could see that horses were not going to be the future cars would be the future does anybody know who this guy is right so steve jobs is what did he say he said that customers normally ask him to give them what they want but that's not his approach his job is to figure out what they're going to do before they do it and to read things they're not yet on the page and that's something that we have to discuss and i think malaysians have great creativity all of us leaders over here yourselves we can brainstorm if we can do amazing things everything virtual assistants are going to be the norm in by 2022 85 of all customer interactions will be handled without accumulation we're working with dbs we're working with many banks we're working with hotels and results to really do things that can cope with our human beings only human beings will be escalated to make decisions but not the money in jobs 24 hours i'm going to skip through this but then there's a big data are many identifying new opportunities reliable decision-making improved official and of course new business opportunities but the biggest biggest question when you ask most people on the street not people in this office not people in this room he said why do you think what are the benefits of ai and digital transformation if you go on the street what is the biggest answer that you get from most people is they will tell you this they don't know and then it's scary because if we don't know and we're still if they don't admit that they don't know it becomes a problem so all of us might not know everything but we need to know that the future is here we need to think about what's going to happen and that is something that we're going to work together champions and leaders essentially those who understand that there's difficult difference between obstacles and opportunity and to turn both into the advantage i wanted to share just one simple network with you here's a simple story that we've heard many times before this story of the hair and the tortoise and i thought it is very relevant in this current era so all of us know this story the hair and the tortoise the hair and the tortoise decided that they wanted to have a race and of course the hair being very quick and speedy so the tortoise of course will challenge you to raise so the herring tortoise started from the you know the starting point he had sped all the way to the nearby when he reached me it way what did he do he was complacent he was lazy so he took a nap and the tortoise saw the head taking a nap and overtook the head of course everybody knows that who won the race he was the oldest so behind the story was that slow and steady means the race because his hair was complacent it was arrogant and we thought that was the end of the story i know it wasn't the end and there was a second story that the second race was that the hair and the tortoise the hair said that i'm so fast it cannot be that i can lose to the 20 squeeze also so this time the hair challenged the tortoise to a second race he said i will challenge you again in the 26th don't worry about this guy he's going to slip it away anyway so they started from the same point and they had spat yeah and of course the tortilla said turmeric is going to sleep but at this time the hair was not complacent he was ironic he went all the way to the finish line and he won the race so what is the moral of this story the second story slow and steady is great it's good but fast and steady always winslow and sticky hands so the hair said you're slow and steady i'm fast and steady so fast it always wins so we thought that that was the end but the third story is that the tortoise said that this came very fast physically gifted let me challenge the guy again he invited her and said i'll challenge you again follow my terms i will decide the route to the race so they started from the same point but the tortoise said i will decide on the finishing line so the hair went all the way i'm not going to sleep i'm not going to fall for this trap so he went all the way and he found out that on the map to hit to the finishing line it was a river the hair started to scratch his head starting to first fight he stopped at everybody he said what am i going to do can't do anything the tortoise slowly came there so that high or river it's okay why is so what is the moral behind the third song slow and steady is good the past activity is greater but if i play to my strengths i will always beat this guy so if you are in the yangtze river don't fight the crocodile if you're in the pacific ocean don't fight the shark if you're in malaysia don't play with the guys say partner if you find a fella who is six foot five don't play basketball honey you want to play a badminton okay [Music] so that was the third story and we thought it was the end so the fourth story is that their hand thought this came together and said okay let's challenge each other again and this time they say that let's do it differently you are very fast i can do a lot of things and i can swim past the river so they they decide on the same route and this time what happened was the hare took the tortoise on his back he ran from the start to the river very fast and when you arrive at the river which they can't go any further the hair then went onto the tortoise back on his shelf and the tortoise brought him faster and then my friends is the end of the story is great if you paid your strengths that's great if you can find a way not to do everything yourself people as partners in collaboration that is [Music] so we all learn lessons if y'all learn from each other i just wanted to share that partnering with us it doesn't mean that you might be everyone of course you have to find people to give these friends and sometimes you find really good partners some people don't but the way that we teach is going to admit our kids jobs that's what jack ma said i met up with him and he was singing oprah and he was sharing he's a very good opera singer stephen hopkins of course says that he's a firm believer that humans are limited by slow biological evolution we can never ever complete and we can be supported and supplemented with some technology some of you might have seen this before if you have roughly writing yes your age the matrix because many of us haven't seen this again who the hell is matrix okay no you don't care if you see this once and zeros but you can see it this way then we can see the real opportunity seeing between the lines and that is something that is truly amazing when sometimes we sit amongst leaders and a spark and the light bulb appears that we suddenly find an inspiration that this is going to change how the industry works so with that i just wanted to share one last thing some key takeaways and some suggestions um i learned from all the business leaders yourselves and steven distinguished case all the time what i do think that is important that what i've learned is that it's important to build skills and capabilities either in-house or through partners sometimes we can do everything alone i've spoken to so many leaders they say okay i'm building hardware i also want to learn how to build software i would build software i also want to do e-commerce i do e-commerce i want to do digital marketing i do digital i'll do manufacturing i do maintenance i do construction i do control and then you ask him oh we have cafeteria everything they want to do then sometimes they think that can they really do it well and this is a problem today a best manufacturer might not be a good marketeer the best marketing might not be a good manufacturer so we have to understand our trends and weaknesses and there's always many ways to work with different people building a partner ecosystem is very good experienced partners who have done it a thousand times would probably have some experience that they have to share like future next if we wanted to have food with a really bad box but we love food but we will get a good partner to prepare the food and if we have somebody who wants to do hardware on buildings we will get the right person to do it as well so focus on operational efficiencies we could wins and tangible roi is very important because sometimes a lot of people go to the boss and say that we invest in this investor but no roi no glad of course the bosses or financials will improve that and then we look at adjacent industries by identifying opportunity and potential threats but one thing that's very important is develop a flexible agile solution treatment because things will change along the way be prepared for that change and be fast identify the neglected unmind opportunities with a clear roman overall strategy but most importantly the most important thing is do not wait whatever the decision is do not wait think about it carefully start small think big with a vision and scale really fast because time waits for no man today we build something and when a crisis strikes we are ready the companies that we've seen in kobe 19 period that are able to stand up are those that help that had a system way those who are not prepared wait for the crisis to hit and try to do it a little bit too late so we can always prepare that but start now um think big with a vision skill fast it doesn't need to be a costly exercise otherwise excuse me i would like to have a spot on that to see that we as fusion ex are very privileged to have you as friends all mrca folks friends you never fantastic leadership team you now have a lot of women power and you have that has made the path and foundation so there's so much energy that i can see fusionx hopefully is a friendly and supportive partner we are happy to help not just in words in strength in spirit in effort in kind and also in funding so it doesn't what we can do for any other things but i do hope that malaysia with all of your leadership will be successful and we are very fortunate to see that you know there are some companies are doing well and we are one of those that we think we can support this because i think it will be great for the country to have increasingly funds so with that i wanted to just say that i want to thank you for everything and the journey of the thousands experience with us thank you so much i hope you have a great session today [Music] so if you have any questions you can always uh approach letters three island sorry um maybe during the get together sessions
