the reason why we have decided to have

us for uh many very large scales

127
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,320
because of the pandemic situation we

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,800
can't do so

129
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,919
but we feel that we are missing you guys

130
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,960
every one of you

131
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,600

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
is really for the purpose of fulfilling

134
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,240
my objectives uh

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,120
for my channel i have here my council

136
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,360
members i just

137
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
wish to just have them to stand up for

138
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,880
you guys to take a look at them do you

139
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:11,759
mind gentlemen and lady

140
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:13,840
for the counselor for 2020-2022

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,120
ladies and gentlemen i ask them to stand

142
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,800
up is because

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,800
if you need help go to them

144
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,160
if you don't do it right it's their

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,080
thoughts

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,000
you know i have a very wonderful thing

147
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,039
because it's not easy

148
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,360
um being a lady

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,280
they like to call me the first ever not

150
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,120
ever yeah the first lady president it's

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,639
not easy actually to hate such a big

152
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,600
organization that

153
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,240
all my past presidents have built you

154
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
know

155
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,199
from actually a 100 strong members our

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
membership has actually reached more

157
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,600
than 500 right now

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,240
but more importantly all of you are

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,199
actually

160
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,720
in amazingly successful businesses so

161
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,280
it's not easy to leave

162
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,160
you know an association of such kind so

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
my team and i

164
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
actually discussed uh that in this very

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,160
crucial time why not have something that

166
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,160
we can come together

167
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,560
and the reason why i want to do so is

168
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,800
actually very much in alignment with

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,080
the very first vision of the founder of

170
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:21,840
mrca

171
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,840
who knows the founder of mrca

172
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,160
is a very humble and very kind you know

173
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,479
you know that he's a founder for pro con

174
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,919
i had a wonderful opportunity to talk to

175
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,720
him several times and

176
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,240
i being a very inquisitive person by

177
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,520
nature i asked him

178
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,680
why did he form mrca he said that

179
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,120
you know something shelly if you want to

180
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,440
be successful in business

181
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,680
you need to join forces because when you

182
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,880
join forces you know everything becomes

183
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,520
easier do you do so here's my very

184
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,199
objective

185
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,960
of actually having this networking

186
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,680
session so that you can actually join

187
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,520
forces

188
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,160
learn from each other share your

189
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,759
knowledge and then we will actually

190
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,400
you know bring your business to another

191
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,720
level my second objective of course

192
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,120
is very much linked to me being a woman

193
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,039
okay being a woman i feel that

194
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,400
it is about time we get our fair share

195
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,160
of recognition

196
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,599
i know that there are wonderful

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,360
gentlemens who actually

198
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,199
recognize our achievements and

199
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,759
capabilities unfortunately

200
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,840
out there is not always the case so the

201
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,919
purpose of setting up the woman division

202
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,280
is to help lots of women to be given the

203
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,680
chance to show

204
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,120
you know their capabilities empower them

205
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,080
so that they can

206
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,720
help to build the nation as well so if

207
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,440
uh

208
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,360
women division was just formally formed

209
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,360
under the leadership of none other than

210
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,240
that you know we are not well

228
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,719
represented

229
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,000

leader with this

234
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,640

more people to join us

236
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,680

237
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,800
chair

238
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:56,880

whenever there are issues pertaining to

248
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,519
the fme industry we could then actually

249
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,600
form a very large coalition to be able

250
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,120
to have a larger representation

251
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
you know sometimes we don't need to

252
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,399
wrestle the arm of the government

253
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,800
but there are times we don't have a

254
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,519
choice no recording you know

255
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,320
okay all right okay my fifth and sixth

256
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,480
will be

257
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
the fifth one will be to really assist

258
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,920
in recovery

259
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
i feel that at this time right now lots

260
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,920
of us are

261
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,640
be suffering a little bit you know um i

262
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,800
was

263
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,399
having a chance to have a little bit of

264
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,600
dialogue with some of you you know y'all

265
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,680
were saying that uh

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
some of you have actually recently just

267
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,040
lifted listed your company

268
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,800
and then you are not really attaining

269
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,959
the desired result we want

270
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,000
i i hope that you'll be patient you know

271
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,680
while many of us

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
do not really see the light at the end

273
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,880
of the tunnel but i feel that if we

274
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,399
are all careful you know do our parts

275
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,240
this bad time will go

276
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,640
and the important thing is we all have

277
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,040
to stay very positive motivated

278
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,399
because we can't let this virus take us

279
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,920
you know but at the same time we're very

280
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,680
careful i read a very interesting

281
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,279
article it seems that we are no longer

282
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,680
having any interest in the virus

283
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,720
but trust me the virus has a lot lots of

284
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,279
interest in us

285
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,200
so let's let's be very careful okay and

286
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,399
my my sixth one will be to set up a

287
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
continuing information

288
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,880
hub for the members i know that in the

289
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,720

290
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,279
of communicating with you guys

291
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,640

council members to work closer together

295
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,760
collectively so that whenever we receive

296
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079

315
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,760
now um i come to this part about my pet

316
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,040
project which is a single mother project

317
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,279
can i have some slime

318
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,279
oh my photo is really nice though

319
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,000
okay so about this uh project why i

320
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,279
actually started this project is because

321
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,360
um

322
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,000
it's very sad to read the newspaper

323
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,920
articles every day do you know that

324
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200
the people who are badly affected in

325
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,600
fact

326
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,880
the most adversely affected are the

327
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,240
single mothers

328
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,279
i i was reading just not long ago

329
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,920
to be precise it was on 25th of august

330
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,720
it was actually a report by this family

331
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,519
on the age in short it's called f.o.e

332
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,480
it was stated that for this you know

333
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,360
whole

334
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,279
pandemic 30 overs and close to 40

335
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,000
percent of the people who are losing

336
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,680
their jobs

337
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,320
a single mother and well still

338
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,760
fifty percent of them have no money of

339
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,440
access to social protection

340
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,480
at all i and the secretary team plus my

341
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,399
committee members visited a lot of

342
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,800
homes you know it was very

343
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,920
heartbreaking you know to see a lot of

344
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,160
single mothers

345
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,959
not only they have to care for their

346
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,360
families

347
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,279
they are basically the only bread winner

348
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,160
for their families as well

349
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,760
so that's how my deputy dr lubin

350
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,240
rightfully put it

351
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,480
it doesn't take us a lot he said 50 no

352
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,480
50 ringgitler minimum 100 okay

353
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,120
we don't actually ask a huge amount of

354
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,320
donation but of course if you are able

355
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,440
to give a little bit more it will be

356
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,079
wonderful

357
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,160
let's do our little part i feel that if

358
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,079
we can take from the society we can give

359
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,760
back to the society as well

360
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,120
lots of single mothers right now need

361
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,079
our help uh

362
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,399
thus far i uh we started the project on

363
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,079
14 august we are going to end it

364
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,920
on the 30th uh september my charity hey

365
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,279
jordan and his team are here they're

366
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,680
working really hard

367
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,000
you know to get a donation to meet our

368
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,079
target of one hundred thousand

369
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,680
um i'm glad to say that we are halfway

370
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,360
there fifty thousand we still have

371
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,519
another fifty thousand to me

372
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,680
but trust me the money will be carefully

373
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,560
managed meticulously distributed to the

374
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,560
right

375
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,240
organization whom we believe you know

376
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,440
the single mothers whom we have will be

377
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,279
able to sustain

378
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,680
and then learn to survive on their own

379
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,399
so hopefully you can take out the qr

380
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,720
code later

381
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,079
and then start to donate to this very

382
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,360
charitable tribe

383
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,839
my foundation chairman is here

384
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,800
with his very noble action he raised 1

385
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,480
million when he

386
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,160
started this project about 2010

387
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,639
i asked the secretary office to check

388
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,519
how much donation we have done so far

389
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,800
it's actually one million as well so i

390
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,040
think we should give ourselves a big

391
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,040
hand

392
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,639
okay the purpose of the co get together

393
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,320
once again you know it's very

394
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,600
interesting that i was told just now

395
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,839
that we are supposed to

396
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,279
go for breakout sessions and in the

397
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,720
breakout sessions you will each have

398
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,390
your own little party

399
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,480
so mine is um

400
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,040
[Music]

401
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,040
i don't know what

402
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
um

403
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,779
[Music]

404
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,920
and i feel that this difficult time

405
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
right now what had been

406
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,360
you know abnormal in the past has to

407
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,000
become part of our life and become

408
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,480
normal

409
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,920
so if we don't know how to you know do

410
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,560
this robotic kind of

411
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,839
um artificial intelligence we have to

412
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,320
all learn from them

413
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,480
so take the advantage advantage to learn

414
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,120
as much from them as possible

415
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,680
so i'm going to sign off here if you

416
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,000

417
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,320
