must be you isn't it for actually hosting this wonderful event and a respected sea level mrcs member i must say that with your mask on i can't actually recognize many of you but it's good to see that your mask is off we are observing the sop but it's fun sometimes to be able to take off the mask a little bit we are getting here to basically hold the first uh ceo get together as how it was explained by dr lewin uh i wanted to call it the networking i say no networking is very serious he likes the word get together get together meaning you can get together and party as well so get together it shall be um i'd like to take a little more to just read out a little bit about fusion next and i'm going to just follow my script because it's so important to say every wonderful thing about what future next has attained today and i'm i'm going to just say a bit is because if i'm going to read everything what they have achieved i will occupy the whole time for this evening so um yeah here it goes fusionnet has actually grown from the ancient based i.t company so for its present status it is actually the largest artificial intelligence recorded in short ai and data technology company not only for the region in fact has helped a lot company to expand globally fissionnet has also helped many conglomerates and sme across the world to improve their businesses with human nice and effective use of technology i like the word technology because i remember when i was given the opportunity to visit this wonderful facility you know i asked that those three ivan one question i'm not sure whether he'll remember i say do you have a post for me i don't mind working here i'm not sure whether you get a chance to tour today but it's really amazing my goodness i i wish you get the facility the opportunity to visit this place and dr sri has actually led and been involved in numerous initiatives advanced technology adoption and local businesses to drive the advancement in the

association of malaysia and the platinum business award in 2018 i trust that the industry ivan and your expert team you will bring about more advancement latest and more impactful innovative to help all of us congratulations for your key achievements okay now i can go free already okay um the reason why we have decided to have dco get together is because we feel that we want to get to know you better as i was saying just now all the past events that mrca has helped us for uh many very large scales because of the pandemic situation we can't do so but we feel that we are missing you guys every one of you you know um uh how we want to come together is really for the purpose of fulfilling my objectives uh for my channel i have here my council members i just wish to just have them to stand up for you guys to take a look at them do you mind gentlemen and lady for the counselor for 2020-2022 ladies and gentlemen i ask them to stand up is because if you need help go to them if you don't do it right it's their thoughts you know i have a very wonderful thing because it's not easy um being a lady they like to call me the first ever not ever yeah the first lady president it's not easy actually to hate such a big organization that all my past presidents have built you know from actually a 100 strong members our membership has actually reached more than 500 right now but more importantly all of you are actually in amazingly successful businesses so it's not easy to leave you know an association of such kind so my team and i actually discussed uh that in this very crucial time why not have something that we can come together and the reason why i want to do so is actually very much in alignment with the very first vision of the founder of mrca who knows the founder of mrca is a very humble and very kind you know you know that he's a founder for pro con i had a wonderful opportunity to talk to him several times and i being a very inquisitive person by nature i asked him why did he form mrca he said that you know something shelly if you want to be successful in business you need to join forces because when you join forces you know everything becomes easier do you do so here's my very objective of actually having this networking session so that you can actually join forces learn from each other share your knowledge and then we will actually you know bring your business to another level my second objective of course is very much linked to me being a woman okay being a woman i feel that it is about time we get our fair share of recognition i know that there are wonderful gentlemens who actually recognize our achievements and capabilities unfortunately out there is not always the case so the purpose of setting up the woman division is to help lots of women to be given the chance to show you know their capabilities empower them so that they can help to build the nation as well so if uh women division was just formally formed under the leadership of none other than that of winnerling dr william can you just say hi to everyone the timeline is empower the woman build the nation do you know something we have already have so many women who are joining the uh the woman division i hope the uh ladies strong ladies of uh fisher next will also join us sorry dr okay my third objective will be really to um enlarge as well as make the f and b industry an impactful one this is really the vision of my very capable ipp 93 garage during his tenure he is always saying that you know we are not well represented for the fact that we have so many fmb uh players you know um you know we our voice is not hurt and we call ourselves the de facto leader with this industry you can't do it we have to have more people to join us and he has personally volunteered to chair that division let's give a big round uh dentistry is going to have his first uh press conference uh is it this month industry probably twenty seconds yeah so for those of you who are in uh fmb please approach him we need your help you know if you could join us and then whenever there are issues pertaining to the fme industry we could then actually form a very large coalition to be able to have a larger representation you know sometimes we don't need to wrestle the arm of the government but there are times we don't have a choice no recording you know okay all right okay my fifth and sixth will be the fifth one will be to really assist in recovery i feel that at this time right now lots of us are be suffering a little bit you know um i was having a chance to have a little bit of dialogue with some of you you know y'all were saying that uh some of you have actually recently just lifted listed your company and then you are not really attaining the desired result we want i i hope that you'll be patient you know while many of us do not really see the light at the end of the tunnel but i feel that if we are all careful you know do our parts this bad time will go and the important thing is we all have to stay very positive motivated because we can't let this virus take us you know but at the same time we're very careful i read a very interesting article it seems that we are no longer having any interest in the virus but trust me the virus has a lot lots of interest in us so let's let's be very careful okay and my my sixth one will be to set up a continuing information hub for the members i know that in the past you know we may be lacking in terms of communicating with you guys you know um sorry we are going to do better we're going to have you know the secretary as well as the council members to work closer together collectively so that whenever we receive any pertinent information we will come to you and let you know but i hope you come to us first because sometimes we may be missing you out if you have any questions you know or do come to us we'll try our level best to help you we would have a lot of uh very influential people here they're all at the front row they can help you ah that is free kicking so and of course my advisor you know my past president as well as uh jen you know i'm sure if you have any pertinent issues that you need advice it will be actually willing to you know lend a helping hand now um i come to this part about my pet project which is a single mother project can i have some slime oh my photo is really nice though okay so about this uh project why i actually started this project is because um it's very sad to read the newspaper articles every day do you know that the people who are badly affected in fact the most adversely affected are the single mothers i i was reading just not long ago to be precise it was on 25th of august it was actually a report by this family on the age in short it's called f.o.e it was stated that for this you know whole pandemic 30 overs and close to 40 percent of the people who are losing their jobs a single mother and well still fifty percent of them have no money of access to social protection at all i and the secretary team plus my committee members visited a lot of homes you know it was very heartbreaking you know to see a lot of single mothers not only they have to care for their families they are basically the only bread winner for their families as well so that's how my deputy dr lubin rightfully put it it doesn't take us a lot he said 50 no 50 ringgitler minimum 100 okay we don't actually ask a huge amount of donation but of course if you are able to give a little bit more it will be wonderful let's do our little part i feel that if we can take from the society we can give back to the society as well lots of single mothers right now need our help uh thus far i uh we started the project on 14 august we are going to end it on the 30th uh september my charity hey jordan and his team are here they're working really hard you know to get a donation to meet our target of one hundred thousand um i'm glad to say that we are halfway there fifty thousand we still have another fifty thousand to me but trust me the money will be carefully managed meticulously distributed to the right organization whom we believe you know the single mothers whom we have will be able to sustain and then learn to survive on their own so hopefully you can take out the qr code later and then start to donate to this very charitable tribe my foundation chairman is here with his very noble action he raised 1 million when he started this project about 2010 i asked the secretary office to check how much donation we have done so far it's actually one million as well so i think we should give ourselves a big hand okay the purpose of the co get together once again you know it's very interesting that i was told just now that we are supposed to go for breakout sessions and in the breakout sessions you will each have your own little party so mine is um [Music] i don't know what um [Music] and i feel that this difficult time right now what had been you know abnormal in the past has to become part of our life and become normal so if we don't know how to you know do this robotic kind of um artificial intelligence we have to all learn from them so take the advantage advantage to learn as much from them as possible so i'm going to sign off here if you remember my tagline powered by you research better powered by you means you will be all the members we will be all the council members thank you very much and have a wonderful evening
