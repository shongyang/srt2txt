africa as well and this was an amazing

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
experience whenever i go to different

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,880
countries

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,920
so when i go to indonesia the indonesian

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,840
[Music]

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,840
and if you go to hong kong

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,160
malaysian and very very proud to be

54
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,680
malaysian

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,800
and then when you go to china

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,319
[Music]

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,720
and of course in malaysia your home

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,040
country you speak

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,000
differently it's just so amazing to be

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,440
in malaysia

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
where you can connect to the rest of the

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,599
world with different cultures

63
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
and of course when i go to korea a lot

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,160
of people approach me and they say

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,160
i think i've seen you on some k-pop

66
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
channel

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,560
i'm just a simple malaysian just like

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,519
all of you and very very proud to be in

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,879
malaysia

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,120
and you know when we go to different

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,720
countries we also get to integrate and

72
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,680
learn from the different cultures

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,319
when i was in africa of you know some of

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,720
the people who brought me to africa

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,640
i was amazed to see that the evolution

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,879
in africa was pretty amazing

77
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,640
i saw people using cashless mobile

78
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,440
devices to transact

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,480
in the retail store when you go to china

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,239
you see people doing

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,480
all these things checking in through the

82
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,720
hotels everything to online channels

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,239
in germany and japan you see people

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,560
using robotic arms to

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,920
to do all the automation in factories

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
and if you think about what we've done

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,720
for silicon valley

88
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,959
a lot of the ideation in silicon valley

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,040
which can visit consistently

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,640
is actually not done in silicon valley

91
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,680
malaysians actually deliver a lot of

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,440
these products

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,760
but it's branded at silicon valley it's

94
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,720
branded as you know the united states is

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,040
branded as europe

96
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,760
but a lot of us in malaysia have amazing

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,440
talent

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,519
and this is what i wanted to share with

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,519
everyone today and hopefully just

100
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,799
have a little bit of a um you know

101
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
sharing session to share

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,840
some things that we've actually gone

103
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480
through i'm not going to take too much

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
time

105
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,080
but what i thought is to give you a bit

106
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,920
of a perspective 200 years ago

107
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
90 percent of the world's population

108
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,400
worked in agriculture

109
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,599
that's 200 years ago today

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,319
about 2 percent of the world's

111
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,760
population works in agriculture

112
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,040
and when my staff told me today i

113
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
thought i could just sit down there with

114
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
all of you and just realize myself

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,599
they say it cannot because you've got to

116
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,040
stand on stage and give a speech but

117
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,360
i've got to work very hard for them just

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,120
as

119
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
they were very hard for the organization

120
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,319
but it's two percent of the world's

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,479
population work in agriculture today

122
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,320
why is that so because technology

123
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,239
advancement has actually led

124
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,720
to a lot of changes and today we don't

125
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,160
need so many human resources to work in

126
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,240
you know farms can anybody make a guess

127
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,479
what is this auto that you see on one

128
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,479
screen

129
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,680
okay maybe some of you say it's a super

130
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,360
computer it's super super computer

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,440
and this supercomputer was the first

132
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,880
machine that contributed in the landing

133
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,840
of apollo 11

134
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,400
in 1969. some of us were born during

135
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,720
that

136
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
some of us were not but in this group i

137
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,960
think

138
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
maybe we have seen her enough to be able

139
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,639
to know in 1969

140
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,160
you know this was a full meet-up now

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,360
this super computer

142
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,199
just to put things in the right

143
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,320
perspective was only

144
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,000
six megabytes improvement size

145
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,479
that is smaller than your pokemon app

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,680
that is 40 000 times smaller than your

147
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,160
iphone

148
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
your iphone has more processing power

149
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,479
and storage compared to this super

150
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,440
computer

151
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,120
that helped apollo 11 in 1969 land

152
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,280
can you imagine the advancements of

153
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,160
technology in your computer that's in

154
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,759
your pocket

155
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,520
has more processing power than this

156
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,000
super computer it can

157
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,520
text it can do messaging and voice you

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
can do internet processing it can be

159
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,720
e-commerce

160
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,000
it can do video and all of the things

161
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,520
that you want to do

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
and this is changing the way that we

163
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,759
work every day the current landscape is

164
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,360
extremely confusing

165
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,199
people talk about social media you can

166
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,759
see more than 243 000

167
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,960
photos uploaded you see 3.8 million

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,120
searches on google

169
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,360
these are just some examples you see a

170
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,680
million swipes you see netflix eighty

171
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,840
seven

172
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,440
thousand two hundred and ten thousand

173
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,720
these are of course estimates are not

174
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,440
exact numbers

175
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,319
but you get the point over the last 60

176
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,840
seconds although

177
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,840
millions millions of reports have been

178
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
generated

179
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,240
it's not like if we go and publish your

180
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,759
website the traffic will come naturally

181
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,440
it's not going to be the case

182
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,039
so this is extremely confusing and the

183
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,319
amount of data that the world is

184
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
throwing at is growing that

185
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,319
exponentially every minute every second

186
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,000
while we're eating when we're sleeping

187
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,600
or we're having lunch we're having

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,639
coffee data is

189
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,720
just growing because people are

190
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,600
searching for products online and this

191
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,759
is something that

192
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,280
we in malaysia have a great opportunity

193
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,840
to understand how this grows

194
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,080
radio took 38 years to reach 50 million

195
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,199
users tv to 13 years internet four years

196
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,800
ipod four years

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,680
and facebook took only nine months to

198
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,840
reach 100 million users

199
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,599
pretty amazing but also intimidating and

200
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,479
daunting and scary

201
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,919
if we do not realize that and of course

202
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,680
this room of learned people

203
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,000
don't have this problem but we know that

204
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
today we have about 7 billion

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,120
in terms of the world's population we

206
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,960
have close to 10 billion connected

207
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,919
device which is more than the population

208
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,599
of the entire world we by 2020 we would

209
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,199
have exceeded 100 billion connected

210
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,360
devices meaning to say

211
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,319
that each of us here don't only have one

212
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
connected device

213
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,400
you have a mobile phone you have a

214
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,919
connected tv you have a connected car

215
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,199
perhaps it connects to this to the

216
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,360
social media connects to

217
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,639
internet you probably have a connected

218
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,160
tablet as well

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,919
and many more connected and your

220
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,840
children also

221
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,199
and this is daunting but it's what's

222
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,120
happening so we have a very very

223
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,919
connected world a hyper connected with

224
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,160
tournament

225
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,759
with 10 billion connected network and

226
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,120
this is going to go 100 billion

227
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,879
over the next eight years so the rate at

228
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
which we're generating data is rapidly

229
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,840
outpacing our human capacity to cope

230
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,599
with it

231
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,960
and we need to be able to do things much

232
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,039
more efficiently

233
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,000
this is as usual as we say whether in

234
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,280
the retail space

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,919
can be just normal and it might be

236
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
simple

237
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,199
because this is what we do to get from a

238
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
to b we ride a bicycle this is just an

239
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,720
analogy

240
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,759
but if we think that's fine every day

241
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
we'll write already might still nothing

242
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,280
wrong

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,479
with it what happens if we find that our

244
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,879
competitors

245
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,400
can actually use this to get to the same

246
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,840
destination

247
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,000
faster better more efficient

248
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,759
and frankly speaking there is no reason

249
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,319
for other people not to use this

250
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,039
if they can go to the same destination

251
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,039
the global landscape is disorientating

252
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,080
there is an eruption of disruptive

253
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,080
technologies

254
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,440
meaning change that incumbents cannot

255
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,519
deal with

256
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,440
and because of the fact that there's a

257
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,560
lot of fluidity and uncertainty

258
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,480
businesses have to strategize today and

259
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,920
no one can assume that traditional basis

260
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
of competitive advantages

261
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,640
will remain things are changing the only

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,720
concept is change so we know about the

263
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,080
first and second and third revolution

264
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,160
the industrial revolution shows that

265
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,399
first initiative is all about steam

266
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,839
called second about mechanization and

267
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,720
third about you know electronics and

268
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,160
factories

269
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,160
and of course the fourth one which is

270
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,720
the most disruptive of them all

271
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,800
i think we heard our energetic mrca

272
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
president talk about ai talk about all

273
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,959
the things that we're doing with all the

274
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,000
good initiatives

275
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,519
ir 4.0 is going to have a massive change

276
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,200
and a massive impact in terms of how

277
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,120
we're doing business

278
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,560
and it doesn't just restrict one gear it

279
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,880
disrupts all

280
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,839
including retail so we are we're looking

281
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,760
at how

282
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,279
pins are changing now let's talk a

283
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,120
little bit about 90.

284
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,480
as we know forbidden numbers has

285
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,000
impacted almost everyone and this is how

286
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,519
maybe a busy street

287
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,279
used to be in perhaps tlcc in town world

288
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,640
and so and so forth

289
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,760
but after 2019 things are very different

290
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,880
pre post and after and this is not just

291
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,200
affecting one industry as we mentioned

292
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,880
we still have a lot of conferences with

293
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,800
people all across the world in fact

294
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,920
our office hours have been longer as you

295
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,200
would imagine

296
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,040
it's now 11 12 1 a.m 2 a.m people are

297
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,399
not so respectful of our time anymore

298
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,000
but we still understand

299
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,440
that they need to function saturday

300
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,320
sundays as well some of you might have

301
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,800
the same problems

302
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,839
i hope not but we have that problem that

303
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,680
people like

304
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
people are at home people are doing

305
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,200
things remotely

306
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,040
and this is not just in southeast asia

307
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,600
it's europe it's in america

308
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,800
it's everywhere and things are changing

309
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,640
very very rapidly

310
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,399
we work with many american brands many

311
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,480
european members many japanese friends

312
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,920
many korean brands many singaporeans

313
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
and face masks are becoming the new

314
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,760
normal

315
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,440
and of course face masks are also slowly

316
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,360
becoming the new fashion

317
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,399
and trend temperature taken everywhere

318
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,519
you go

319
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,800
and our new best friend and sanitizer

320
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,240
lots of things are changing as we speak

321
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,279
one thing i'd like to share and put

322
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,200
things in perspective in 1964

323
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:59,760
smp 500 companies 10 year

324
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,120
average lifespan 33 years and that was

325
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
how long this company would last before

326
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,440
it gets acquired

327
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,440
or whether it would disappear in 2016

328
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:13,120
this lifespan reduced to 24 years

329
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,360
in 2027 it is only 12 years

330
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,399
it is extremely intimidating this is

331
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,399
from mckinsey

332
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,440
and you will see that this information

333
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,839
is extremely

334
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,959
intimidating that means if companies

335
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
don't evolve

336
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,320
we are not going to be relevant so

337
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,519
that's something

338
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,720
so constant change is a new norm

339
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
one of the things that we've seen in

340
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,480
terms of the long-lasting profit 19 when

341
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,720
we talk to many of our customers

342
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
in and across the world that's prior

343
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,640
less current and this

344
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and this future the new global consumer

345
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,519
research shows that consumers are

346
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,279
radically changing their lives in

347
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,360
response to economy

348
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,320
they are becoming more savvy they are

349
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,160
still buying

350
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,600
many consumers are facing new personal

351
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,320
situations what that means is that maybe

352
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,560
some of them

353
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,959
have lost their jobs some of them are

354
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,399
more conscious about hygiene factors

355
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,920
some of them don't want to go up too

356
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,040
much but they want to do the research

357
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,200
online

358
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,480
and consumers are shopping with greater

359
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,480
awareness of the environment

360
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,079
but there is a huge rise there's no

361
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,079
denial that there's huge rise in digital

362
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,760
commerce especially in low or new

363
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,360
low frequency customers might need to

364
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,240
continue prospering so you can see that

365
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,519
the sales

366
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,800
and and everything pre is is shaded in

367
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,040
gray and current in light purple

368
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,639
and of course the future so this is not

369
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680
going to be something that disappears

370
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,440
that people come back

371
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,040
to the train they are so used to working

372
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,800
from home they are so used to

373
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,399
dealing with things online so this is

374
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,760
going to change very very rapidly

375
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,279
so one of the things that we probably

376
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,480
have to take a look at is how we disrupt

377
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,320
and reinvent our businesses

378
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,000
i've had the opportunity to meet up with

379
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,639
all these guys apart from

380
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,360
choice icon and all these guys amazing

381
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,240
people

382
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,200
jeff bezos jack ma kirby chen and karin

383
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
always is looking

384
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,399
of course richard branson

385
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,079
and the way they think is crazy out

386
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,279
there

387
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,560
the only other guy i haven't had a

388
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,279
chance to meet but i'll never have to

389
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,440
see is

390
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,560
steve jobs but the rest of the guys

391
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
they're all crazy guys

392
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,040
right and what they've done is they've

393
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,760
disrupted different types of businesses

394
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,600
um and just revolutionize how things

395
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,040
really happen

396
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,720
one thing that we should think about is

397
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,000
that if you think of holden

398
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,120
or gm toyota these are all good

399
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,639
brands but when you think of tesla

400
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,480
tesla is more valuable in all in

401
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,160
particular

402
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,839
how can the big health service have

403
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
enough sales tesla doesn't have enough

404
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,480
profits

405
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,480
it's just crazy but they have actually

406
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
innovated it to a state of your own

407
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,040
right of course you don't want to take

408
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,040
struck sometimes

409
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,800
but the innovation stuff is there and

410
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,399
hopefully infusion is also none of us do

411
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,839
that

412
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,320
how do we cope with the new world order

413
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,680
and new economic frontier we need to

414
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,480
think about how we

415
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,000
deal with the world with driverless cars

416
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,639
and maybe think about this

417
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,279
the car of tomorrow will become of the

418
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
horse will become the horse of the day

419
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,800
let me ponder for a moment that is a

420
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,680
wonderful moment to think about that

421
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:10,480
what is the horse of today

422
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,079
the horse of the day and the horse of

423
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,199
yesterday the horses yesterday was a

424
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,600
necessity

425
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,800
the horse of today is the laundry you

426
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,000
don't need a horse

427
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,040
the car of today is a necessity the car

428
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,399
tomorrow

429
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,519
maybe you don't need a car anymore maybe

430
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,800
there's a drivers car that takes you

431
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,920
around you don't need to park

432
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,160
so things are going to change very

433
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,199
rapidly and what we think today is the

434
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,199
norm

435
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,040
will result in a new norm very very

436
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,399
quickly that is what we discuss with

437
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,839
business leaders every day

438
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,360
they say that this is the problem i'm

439
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,079
facing can we say what do you think is

440
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
going to happen

441
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,120
in three months time six month time

442
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,199
three years i think it's gonna move

443
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,040
towards this is it is it true

444
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
let's think about it a bit more if you

445
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,680
think it's going to happen in six months

446
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,800
time

447
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,000
then do it now because when the month

448
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,160
number six arrives

449
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,279
and you try to do it like what happened

450
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,560
in kobe 19

451
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,000
you're right now we're going to go into

452
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,680
a digital transformation it's a little

453
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,880
bit too late because

454
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,959
because it's already happened so we need

455
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
to think of the next one but never too

456
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,000
late

457
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,680
if we are starting something early um

458
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,240
there are a lot of disruptors netflix

459
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,720
uber

460
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,240
amazon airbnb we can't blame them

461
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,480
because the market is

462
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,040
i'm doing this does anybody know who

463
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,040
this guy is

464
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,160
kevin costner

465
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,920
yeah second report right so one of the

466
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,160
famous things that senator paul said is

467
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,360
that people he had asked his customers

468
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,959
what they wanted

469
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,399
they would have told him that they

470
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,240
needed plaster forces

471
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,560
fortunately he didn't do faster horses

472
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,000
and he invented the automobiles and cars

473
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,880
and that's why we benefited from it

474
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,480
as you could see that horses were not

475
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,600
going to be the future

476
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,199
cars would be the future does anybody

477
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,399
know who this guy is

478
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,240
right so steve jobs is what did he say

479
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,079
he said that

480
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
customers normally ask him to give them

481
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,480
what they want but that's not his

482
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,839
approach

483
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,680
his job is to figure out what they're

484
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,959
going to do before they do it and to

485
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,000
read things they're not yet on the page

486
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,360
and that's something that we have to

487
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,720
discuss and i think malaysians have

488
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,639
great creativity

489
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,639
all of us leaders over here yourselves

490
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,199
we can brainstorm if we can do amazing

491
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,279
things

492
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,120
everything virtual assistants are going

493
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,160
to be the norm

494
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,440
in by 2022 85 of all customer

495
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,240
interactions will be handled without

496
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,160
accumulation

497
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,920
we're working with dbs we're working

498
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,240
with many banks we're working with

499
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,759
hotels and results to really do things

500
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,399
that can cope with our

501
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,000
human beings only human beings will be

502
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,639
escalated to make decisions but not the

503
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,079
money in jobs 24 hours

504
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,560
i'm going to skip through this but then

505
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,320
there's a big data are many identifying

506
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,160
new opportunities reliable

507
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,759
decision-making improved official and of

508
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,440
course new business opportunities

509
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,040
but the biggest biggest question when

510
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,880
you ask most people on the street not

511
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,360
people in this office not people in this

512
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,199
room

513
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
he said why do you think what are the

514
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,240
benefits of ai

515
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,920
and digital transformation if you go on

516
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,680
the street what is the biggest

517
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,680
answer that you get from most people

518
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,319
is they will tell you this they don't

519
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,559
know

520
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,439
and then it's scary because if we don't

521
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,880
know

522
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,480
and we're still if they don't admit that

523
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,079
they don't know it becomes a problem so

524
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,000
all of us might not know everything

525
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,120
but we need to know that the future is

526
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,679
here we need to think about what's going

527
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,720
to happen

528
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,720
and that is something that we're going

529
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,919
to work together champions and leaders

530
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,199
essentially those who understand that

531
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,400
there's difficult difference between

532
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,720
obstacles and opportunity

533
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,319
and to turn both into the advantage i

534
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,520
wanted to share just one simple network

535
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,120
with you

536
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,559
here's a simple story that we've heard

537
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,799
many times before

538
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,320
this story of the hair and the tortoise

539
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,480
and i thought it is very relevant in

540
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,880
this current era

541
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,600
so all of us know this story the hair

542
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,600
and the tortoise

543
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,679
the hair and the tortoise decided that

544
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,320
they wanted to have a race

545
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,440
and of course the hair being very quick

546
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,039
and speedy

547
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,039
so the tortoise of course will challenge

548
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,120
you to raise so the herring

549
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,720
tortoise started from the you know the

550
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,360
starting point

551
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,400
he had sped all the way to the nearby

552
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,440
when he reached me

553
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,559
it way what did he do he was complacent

554
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,880
he was lazy so he took a nap

555
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,039
and the tortoise saw the head taking a

556
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,600
nap and overtook the head

557
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,160
of course everybody knows that who won

558
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,120
the race

559
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,000
he was the oldest so behind the story

560
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,160
was that

561
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,559
slow and steady means the race because

562
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,840
his hair was complacent it was arrogant

563
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,880
and we thought that was the end of the

564
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,320
story i know it wasn't the end

565
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,480
and there was a second story that

566
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,520
the second race was that the hair and

567
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,000
the tortoise

568
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,520
the hair said that i'm so fast it cannot

569
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,240
be that i can lose to the 20 squeeze

570
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,919
also

571
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,679
so this time the hair challenged the

572
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,200
tortoise to a second race he said i will

573
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,240
challenge you again in the 26th don't

574
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,520
worry about this guy

575
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,080
he's going to slip it away anyway so

576
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,480
they started from the same point and

577
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,320
they had spat

578
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,679
yeah and of course the tortilla said

579
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,039
turmeric is going to sleep

580
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,960
but at this time the hair was not

581
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,480
complacent he was ironic he went all the

582
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,200
way to the finish line and he won the

583
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,640
race

584
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,480
so what is the moral of this story the

585
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,520
second story

586
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,000
slow and steady is great

587
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,960
it's good but fast and steady always

588
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
winslow and sticky hands

589
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,400
so the hair said you're slow and steady

590
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,120
i'm fast and steady

591
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,840
so fast it always wins so we thought

592
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,840
that that was the end

593
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,960
but the third story is that the tortoise

594
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,200
said that

595
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,880
this came very fast physically gifted

596
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,559
let me challenge the guy again

597
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,919
he invited her and said i'll challenge

598
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,520
you again follow

599
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,160
my terms i will decide the route to the

600
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,679
race so they started from the same point

601
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,880
but the tortoise said i will decide on

602
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,559
the finishing line

603
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,600
so the hair went all the way i'm not

604
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,039
going to sleep i'm not going to fall for

605
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,120
this trap so he went all the way

606
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,160
and he found out that on the map to hit

607
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,280
to the finishing line

608
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,559
it was a river the hair

609
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,760
started to scratch his head starting to

610
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,640
first fight he stopped at everybody he

611
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,320
said what am i going to do

612
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,760
can't do anything the tortoise slowly

613
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:06,080
came there so that

614
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,880
high or river it's okay why is so what

615
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,600
is the moral

616
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,240
behind the third song slow and steady is

617
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,640
good

618
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
the past activity is greater but if i

619
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,320
play to my strengths

620
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,760
i will always beat this guy so if you

621
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,520
are in the yangtze river

622
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,679
don't fight the crocodile if you're in

623
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,280
the pacific ocean don't fight the shark

624
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,679
if you're in malaysia don't play with

625
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,240
the guys say partner

626
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,240
if you find a fella who is six foot five

627
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,190
don't play basketball

628
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,280
honey you want to play a badminton okay

629
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,960
[Music]

630
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,600
so that was the third story and we

631
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,600
thought it was the end

632
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,720
so the fourth story is that their hand

633
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,159
thought this came together and said okay

634
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,080
let's challenge each other again

635
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,400
and this time they say that let's do it

636
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,400
differently you are very fast

637
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,480
i can do a lot of things and i can swim

638
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,360
past the river so they they decide on

639
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,520
the same route

640
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,280
and this time what happened was the hare

641
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,679
took the tortoise on his back

642
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,559
he ran from the start to the river very

643
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,159
fast

644
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,760
and when you arrive at the river which

645
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,360
they can't go any further

646
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,039
the hair then went onto the tortoise

647
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,600
back on his shelf and the tortoise

648
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,720
brought him

649
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,760
faster and then my friends

650
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,760
is the end of the story

651
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,159
is great if you paid your strengths

652
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,320
that's great if you can find a way

653
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,240
not to do everything yourself people as

654
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,640
partners in collaboration

655
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,640
that is

656
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,900
[Music]

657
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400
so we all learn lessons if y'all learn

658
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
from each other

659
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,520
i just wanted to share that partnering

660
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
with us it doesn't mean that you might

661
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
be everyone

662
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,440
of course you have to find people to

663
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,799
give these friends and sometimes you

664
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
find really good partners some people

665
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,360
don't

666
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,440
but the way that we teach is going to

667
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,520
admit our kids jobs that's what

668
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,720
jack ma said i met up with him and he

669
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,840
was singing oprah

670
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,840
and he was sharing

671
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,039
he's a very good opera singer

672
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,120
stephen hopkins of course says that he's

673
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,280
a firm believer that humans are limited

674
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,120
by slow biological evolution

675
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,280
we can never ever complete and we can be

676
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,840
supported and supplemented with some

677
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,840
technology

678
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,159
some of you might have seen this before

679
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,080
if you have roughly writing yes your age

680
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,600
the matrix because many of us haven't

681
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,120
seen this again who the hell is

682
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,679
matrix okay no you don't care

683
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,799
if you see this once and zeros but you

684
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,480
can see it this way

685
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,840
then we can see the real opportunity

686
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,200
seeing between the lines

687
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,120
and that is something that is truly

688
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,559
amazing when sometimes we sit amongst

689
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,840
leaders and a spark

690
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,679
and the light bulb appears that we

691
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,919
suddenly find an inspiration that this

692
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,960
is going to change how the industry

693
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,640
works

694
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,000
so with that i just wanted to share one

695
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,080
last thing

696
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,200
some key takeaways and some suggestions

697
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,360
um i learned from

698
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,280
all the business leaders yourselves and

699
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,880
steven distinguished case all the time

700
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,799
what i do think that is important that

701
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,080
what i've learned is that

702
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,840
it's important to build skills and

703
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,640
capabilities either in-house or through

704
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
partners

705
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,840
sometimes we can do everything alone

706
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,679
i've spoken to so many leaders they say

707
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,960
okay i'm building hardware i also want

708
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,000
to learn how to build software i would

709
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,520
build software i also want to do

710
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,039
e-commerce i do e-commerce i want to do

711
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,400
digital marketing i do digital i'll do

712
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,600
manufacturing i do maintenance i do

713
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,120
construction i do control

714
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,760
and then you ask him oh we have

715
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,280
cafeteria

716
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
everything they want to do then

717
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,520
sometimes they think that can they

718
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,520
really do it well

719
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,880
and this is a problem today a best

720
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,760
manufacturer might not be a good

721
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,200
marketeer

722
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,200
the best marketing might not be a good

723
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,480
manufacturer so we have to understand

724
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,000
our trends and weaknesses

725
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,159
and there's always many ways to work

726
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,159
with different people building a partner

727
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,520
ecosystem is very good

728
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,200
experienced partners who have done it a

729
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,640
thousand times would probably have some

730
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,320
experience that they have to share

731
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,400
like future next if we wanted to have

732
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,200
food with a really bad box but we love

733
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,960
food

734
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,320
but we will get a good partner to

735
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,159
prepare the food and

736
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,000
if we have somebody who wants to do

737
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,679
hardware on buildings we will get

738
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,600
the right person to do it as well so

739
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,120
focus on operational efficiencies we

740
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,080
could wins and tangible roi is very

741
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,600
important because

742
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,279
sometimes a lot of people go to the boss

743
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,799
and say that we invest in this investor

744
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,480
but no roi no glad

745
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,240
of course the bosses or financials will

746
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,600
improve that and then we look at

747
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,919
adjacent industries by identifying

748
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,840
opportunity and potential threats

749
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,279
but one thing that's very important is

750
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,200
develop a flexible

751
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,799
agile solution treatment because things

752
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,640
will change along the way

753
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,559
be prepared for that change and be fast

754
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,400
identify the neglected unmind

755
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,120
opportunities with a clear roman overall

756
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,919
strategy

757
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,720
but most importantly the most important

758
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,320
thing is

759
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,880
do not wait whatever the decision is

760
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,919
do not wait think about it carefully

761
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,320
start small

762
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,279
think big with a vision and scale really

763
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,840
fast

764
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,880
because time waits for no man today we

765
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,600
build something

766
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,760
and when a crisis strikes we are ready

767
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,400
the companies that we've seen in kobe 19

768
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,640
period

769
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,240
that are able to stand up are those that

770
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,120
help that had a system

771
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,120
way

772
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,960
those who are not prepared wait for the

773
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,640
crisis to hit and try to do it

774
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,559
a little bit too late so we can always

775
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,200
prepare that but start now

776
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,960
um think big with a vision skill fast it

777
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,880
doesn't need to be a costly exercise

778
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,240
otherwise excuse me i would like to have

779
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,000
a spot on that to see that

780
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,279

785
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,520
you have

786
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,760
that has made the path and foundation so

787
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,200
there's so much energy that i can see

788
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,200
fusionx hopefully is a friendly and

789
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,400
supportive partner we are happy to help

790
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,000

791
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,320
in words in strength in spirit in effort

792
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,679
in kind and also in funding so it

793
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,320
doesn't what we can do for any other

794
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,840
things but i do hope that malaysia

795
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,720
with all of your leadership will be

796
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,559
successful and

797
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,760
we are very fortunate to see that you

798
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,240
know there are some companies are doing

799
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
well

800
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,520
and we are one of those that we think we

801
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,880
can support this because i think

802
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,799
it will be great for the country to have

803
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,760
increasingly funds so with that i wanted

804
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,679
